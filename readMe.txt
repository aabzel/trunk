Software architectural design:

Code Base core for various microcontrollers (Cortex M4/Cortex M33/RISC-V).

Code Base has been covered by unit tests.

There is a bootloader configuration.

That is the single-thread super cicle with interrupts code base firmware.


Lots of parameters can be stored in none volatile on chip Nor-Flash File system NVRAM.

Configuration are verified in CD Jenkins.

Hardware independed part of code base has been built in X86/GCC/MinGW/32bit invironment.
